<h1>quiz-app</h1>
  <p>For convenience, I created a Docker script and a docker-compose script to facilitate setup<p>
  <p>The script can be launched with the command 'docker compose build' / 'docker compose up -d'</p>
  <p>I created an admin user ( pw admin ) for the purpose of monitoring the platform and managing exports in CSV, Json and other formats</p>
  <p>Regarding the user typology, I structured two groups, one of participant and one of creator, I created two django commands to allow the setup of the two groups ( create_groups.py) and for the creation of a quiz creator account (create_creator_account.py)</p>
  <p>Invitation management is done through an SMTP server in the console that prints the invitation for the user to accept via e-mail, after which he or she will receive the credentials auto-generated by the system.<p>
  <p>I structured an infrastructure of REST APIs that respond to the endpoint http://127.0.0.1:8000/apiv1/ - as authentication I preferred to use JWT Tokens exposed on 2 endpoints http://127.0.0.1:8000/token/ and http://127.0.0.1:8000/token/refresh/
I also managed a group hierarchy where before detaching a Token for a course participant it is verified that actually the person who is requesting to the call is a participant not a creator.</p>
<p>These are the patterns I created for the routes of the various REST endpoints

'quiz/'
'quiz/<int:quiz_id>/'
'quiz/<int:quiz_id>/questions/'
'quiz/<int:quiz_id>/question/<int:question_id>/'

are all configured in GET except for the last endpoint which allows a post call to insert an answer to a question by specifying the appropriate answer id </p>

<p>As for the testing part, I integrated only 8 Unit tests on the various endpoints of the API mainly because of a time issue, a TDD approach would have been better.</p>
 
  <h2>Future implementations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>the question/answer creation flow in the frontend part is not structured smoothly from the UX/UI point of view</li>
    <li>Invitation management needs to be integrated with django's sand_mass_mail system and the management of an email list in the form part.</li>
    <li>Integration of a UUID during score submission by quiz creators to address possible tampering issues </li>
  </ul>

<h3>I had to add the django-invitations package directly from the wheel files because the one present in PyPi has a bug that didn't allow me to send Signals correctly via the request.</h3>
