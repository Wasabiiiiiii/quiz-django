django-invitations documentation
================================

Generic invitations solution with adaptable backend and support for django-allauth.  All emails and messages are fully customisable.

Originally written as an invitations solution for the excellent `django-allauth <https://github.com/pennersr/django-allauth>`_, this app has been refactored to remove the allauth dependency whilst retaining 100% backwards compatibility.
